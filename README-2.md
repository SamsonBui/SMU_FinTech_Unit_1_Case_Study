# IBM Blockchain Case Study

## Samson Bui

## This is a case study on the blockchain department in IBM improving the FinTech industry.

* IBM Blockchain for Financial Services

* IBM was founded by Charles Ranlett Flint in 1911 with the intent of developing and progressing technological innovation. IBM began developing and introduced blockchain in 2008 as an open-source solution branching out into financial services and other industries.

* IBM began devloping in-house blockchains after the wide-spread attention of crypotcurrencies believing that the underlying technology behind it was the technological innovation that traditional data utilization needed in multiple industries. 

* IBM was founded through the merge of three manufacturing businesses. IBM has 12 investors total with a total of 19 million USD of funding through three funding rounds. In 2001, they receieved 12 million USD in series C from BancBoston Ventures and acculumulated an unknown amount from 1911-2001 VC's. They have a workforce of 350,000 people.

## Business Activities:

* IBM aims to innovate the financial network by creating an ecosystem of trust for global trade through blockchain; with the target client being banks. The blockchain speeds up the process of financial netting and solves issues related to trust, managing truth and transparency of data. IBM does this by creating a ledger through blockchain turning time-consuming processes such as the verification of one's assets into a time-efficient process.

* IBM uses what they call a "Hyperledger Fabric" blockchain to create their platform. The open-source solution offerse productivity tools for creating, managing and operating blockchain solutions providing end-to-end implementations.

* IBM leads the industry with over 200 million USD invested in research and development, their workforce and knowledge out-competes their competitors. IBM conducted a study that by 2018, 91% of banks invested in blockchain solutions predicting that all banks will use this technology by 2025.

## Landscape:

* IBM's Blockchain department specializes in multiple industries. Their financial services branch is under the fintech industry. A major trend in this industry has been the possibility blockchain solutions since Bitcoin proved blockchain to be a reliable ledger in 2008; this was the inspiration of the start of the department. Companies and startups began racing to creating their own in-house blockchain solutions in fintech since the trend. IBM's biggest competitors are Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon and SAP.

## Results:

* IBM has made a major impact in trade finance systems. IBM Blockchain solutions have allowed banks to create new business models, uncover new liquidity pools, and the ability to depend on distrubuted ledger technology. This allows banks to have control capabilities to trade finance data with real-time access.

* With more banks investing into blockchain to improve their fintech aspect of business, blockchain continues to grow with IBM leading in the new data storage technology. This makes IBM a powerhouse in the blockchain domain in not just fintech, but other industries: supply chain, oil and gas, etc.

* IBM's biggest single competitor is Microsoft. IBM is currently the leader in ABI Research industrial blockchain. The Everest assessment ranked IBM for having the most "robust" platform compared to their competitors with Microsoft not being too far behind. 

## Recommendations:

* A service I would recommend, would be to have more focus in the department. IBM has been reorganizing the blockchain development moving people out of the department putting less attention on the technology. The technology shows promise in being an innovative technology that the world needs.

* The decision to keep the workforce strong in the department will keep IBM on the top of the blockchain industry. With nearly all major software companies racing to creating the most "robust" blockchain platform, it is not a position to take for granted. 

* Keeping the workforce strong keeps the IBM blockchain platform strong and constantly improve. This would not only improve the way banking and other industries perform, but it would help grow the economy by cutting costs.
